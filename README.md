#SQL Queries
This repository contains a collection of SQL queries that I wrote while practicing my skills. Each query is contained in a separate file and is named according to the task it performs.

Files
Here is a list of the files in this repository and a brief description of what each query does:

customers.sql: Retrieves a list of customers from the customers table.
orders.sql: Retrieves a list of orders from the orders table.
products.sql: Retrieves a list of products from the products table.
order_details.sql: Retrieves a list of order details from the order_details table.
sales_report.sql: Generates a sales report by joining the orders, order_details, and products tables.
Usage
To use these SQL queries, simply copy and paste the contents of the desired file into your SQL editor and execute the query against your database. Note that these queries were written against a specific database schema, so you may need to modify them slightly to fit your own schema.

License
These SQL queries are released under the MIT license. See the LICENSE file for more information.
