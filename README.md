# SQL Queries
This repository contains a collection of SQL queries that I wrote for self-practice and to work on personal projects. Each query is contained in a separate file and is named according to the task it performs.

## Files
Here is a list of the files in this repository and a brief description of what each query does:

**_CovidDataQuery.sql_**: Contains queries that gives insight to global cases, vaccinations and deaths resulting from the deadly COVID-19 virus.
**_Queries for SQLite.sql_**: Contains queries that are appropriate for SQLite syntax.
**_YELP Dataset SQL Lookup.sql_**: Contains queries retrieves data from the online Yelp database.
**_Adventure Works Cycles.sql_**: Contains queries that retrieves data from the 'AdventureWorks2019.bak' database file provided by Microsoft.

## Usage
To use these SQL queries, simply copy and paste the contents of the desired file into your SQL editor and execute the query against your database. Note that these queries were written against a specific database schema, so you may need to modify them slightly to fit your own schema.

## Contributing
