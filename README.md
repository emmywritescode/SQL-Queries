# SQL Queries
![](sql_.png)
## Introduction
This repository contains a collection of SQL queries that I wrote for self-practice or to work on personal projects. Each sql file contains a list of well formatted queries that are self-explanatory.

## Files
Here is a list of the files in this repository and a brief description of what each query does:

- **_CovidDataQuery.sql_**: Contains queries that gives insight to global cases, vaccinations and deaths resulting from the deadly COVID-19 virus.
- **_Queries for SQLite.sql_**: Contains queries that are appropriate for SQLite syntax.
- **_YELP Dataset SQL Lookup.sql_**: Contains queries that retrieves data from the online Yelp database.
- **_Adventure Works Cycles.sql_**: Contains queries that retrieves data from the 'AdventureWorks2019.bak' database provided by Microsoft.

## Usage
To use these SQL queries, simply copy and paste the contents of the desired file into your SQL editor and execute the query against your database. Note that these queries were written against a specific database schema, so you may need to modify them slightly to fit your own schema.

## Contributing
